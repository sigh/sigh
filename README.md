### Hi there


These are mainly side-projects for things I find algorithmically or mathematically interesting. The interactive ones are hosted at [sigh.github.io](http://sigh.github.io).

The focus is much more on exploring concepts, so there is less attention or time spent on software engineering best-practices than I would on production-quality software.

Feel free to reach out if any of it is interesting to you.
